### Who Am I and What Do I Do?

I'm Liam and I'm a Meteorologist by trade who also loves coding and homelabbing. I have a masters in Meteorology and a PhD where my research focussed on the internal structure and development of thunderstorms. If you are interested you can find my [PhD Thesis here](https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/103906/2/22003320_TILL_Thesis_Liam%20Till%20%282%29.pdf) titled *"Observations and Characteristics of Updraught Structures using High Resolution Radar Observations"*.

I'm a Systems Manager and Assistant Weather Forecaster by day, managing multiple servers and developing software for an SME where we produce weather and loss forecasts for the insurance sector. My day involves weather forecasting, managing on-prem and cloud servers, MySQL database management and administration, developing software to obtain and process weather observations and forecasts, on-demand projects from clients, management of customer facing websites/tools and technical support.

By night I like to work on my homelab, my own coding projects and research stocks and the stock market. Python is my language of choice and I have been coding in Python for over 5 years and love working with data. I enjoy running my own Homelab, with the purpose of this site to blog my journey into the [homelab rabbit hole](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/). I've always had an interest in IT/Tech and have had a somewhat small homelab over the years. I've upgraded after falling deeper into the homelab hole and run a larger server which my wife and I use. My main focus is to learn new tech/software stacks so that I can improve my skillset.

### Why is this blog called totoslab.co.uk?

This blog and some of my homelab is named after our dog Toto. After all he is the one who works the hardest in keeping the homelab running! ...and he's cute

### What's this blog about

I started this site to blog about my homelab, projects and new skills I learn. I've read and used many many blogs over the years which have helped me learn new things, get systems/applications setup and helped with bug fixing. It's been useful to follow along with someones post. So, I thought it would be a good idea for me to start a blog to post about things I've learnt and will be learning. This is two sided

1. This blog will serve as documentation for me so anything I do can be documented and I don't have to dig around again to figure out how to do what I already did! 
2. Hopefully you ü´µ or someone else will find my posts useful like I did reading others blogs. I hope to be able to provide _some_ useful content for others interested in homelabbing and learning different tech stacks.

My goals are 

- To document my progress and provide content to help other homelabbers
- Learn DevOps principles using my homelab to deploy and manage services
